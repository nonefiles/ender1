        "content": "FAIRYTALE THERAPY\nFairytale therapy is a form of therapy aimed at reaching the person's inner world, thoughts and feelings through fairytales. Fairytale therapy, which is a kind of art therapy, works on the person identifying with the characters in the fairytales and gaining new perspectives on their own life story.\n\nFairytale therapy is frequently used by psychologists and counselors, especially working with children. However, this form of therapy can also help adults understand their life stories, experiences and problems. Fairytale therapy can contribute to the person understanding themselves and the events they experience better, solving emotional difficulties and personal development.\n\nFairytale therapy is a journey that gives people a new perspective on their life stories, problems and experiences. In this journey, we step into the magical world of fairytales and embark on adventures with heroes. In the world of fairytales, we find the chance to rewrite and make sense of our own story.\n\nFairytale therapy is a creative and fun form of therapy. In the colorful and vivid world of fairytales, we can rediscover our own story and give it a new meaning. Fairytale therapy can contribute to developing resilience against life's difficulties, protecting our emotional health and personal development.\n\nFairytale therapy is also a process of introspection and self-discovery. Through the events experienced and problems solved by fairytale characters, the person finds the opportunity to see the difficulties and solutions in their own life more clearly. The person who finds the opportunity to express and make sense of their own story with the symbolic language of fairytales becomes able to manage complex situations and emotional conflicts in their life better.\n\nFairytale therapy also encourages creativity and imagination. The colorful world of fairytales helps the person see their own story from a new and different perspective. In this process, the person recreates the characters, events and conflicts in their own life in the universe of fairytales and finds the opportunity to make emotional analyzes in this way.\n\nThe fairytales used in the therapy process can be selected according to the person's life experiences, emotional state and needs. Each fairytale can offer a different life lesson, solution or perspective. Therefore, fairytale therapy is a unique and flexible form of therapy.\n\nAs a result, fairytale therapy offers an effective way to make sense of the person's emotional world, express themselves and support the personal development process. Along with other art therapy forms such as bibliotherapy and cinematherapy, fairytale therapy can also be used as an effective tool in individual and group therapies.",
